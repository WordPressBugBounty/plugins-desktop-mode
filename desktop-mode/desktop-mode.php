/**
 * Whether the current request needs the admin-rendering modules.
 *
 * Most of the plugin must load on every request — feature modules
 * register REST routes, record content mutations that can originate
 * on the frontend (comment submission, WooCommerce orders, plugin-
 * driven post saves), and expose `openstation_register_*()` APIs
 * that third-party plugins call from their own `init` hooks in any
 * context. But the admin *rendering* layer (shell markup, asset
 * enqueues, the chromeless bridge, admin notices, migrations, the
 * `wp_ajax_*` save handler) only ever fires on hooks that don't
 * exist outside wp-admin — so a pure frontend page view can skip
 * parsing and wiring ~6,500 lines of it.
 *
 * Anything ambiguous loads everything: admin (including admin-ajax,
 * where Heartbeat lands), REST (sniffed early — `REST_REQUEST` isn't
 * defined until `parse_request`), cron, WP-CLI, and the PHPUnit
 * environment (the test bootstrap loads the plugin outside admin
 * context but exercises the render layer directly).
 *
 * @return bool True to load the admin-rendering modules.

/**
 * Cascade-deactivate plugins that declare `Requires Plugins: desktop-mode`
 * when OpenStation itself is being deactivated.
 *
 * Without this, a third-party plugin like `os-messages` keeps
 * its `init` hook armed after OpenStation is turned off — the next
 * admin page load fires `init`, the hook calls
 * `openstation_register_window()`, and the request fatals because the
 * function lives in the plugin we just deactivated. The user lands on
 * a white screen instead of the classic admin we redirected them to.
 *
 * WordPress's plugin dependency feature (6.5+) blocks ACTIVATION of a
 * plugin whose declared `Requires Plugins` aren't all active, but it
 * does NOT auto-deactivate dependents when their requirement is
 * deactivated through any path — the user is expected to do that
 * themselves. The classic plugins.php list shows a warning; the REST
 * controller (`PUT /wp/v2/plugins/desktop-mode/openstation`) we route
 * through has no such gate. So we cascade ourselves.
 *
 * Timing: `deactivate_plugins()` writes `active_plugins` to the DB
 * AFTER its hook loop finishes. If we call `deactivate_plugins()`
 * from inside our `register_deactivation_hook` callback, our nested
 * write-back is overwritten the moment the outer call runs its own
 * `update_option`. So we register the cascade to fire on
 * `shutdown` — by then the outer `deactivate_plugins` has finished
 * and our write-back sticks.
 *
 * Matching uses `WP_Plugin_Dependencies::get_dependents()` keyed on
 * our own directory slug (`dirname( plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) )`),
 * which is the same string the dependent's `Requires Plugins` header
 * resolves against. The filter below lets sites widen or narrow the
 * cascade — e.g. add a plugin that wraps `openstation_*` calls in
 * `function_exists` guards and shouldn't be torn down with us.
 *
 * Silent deactivation (`$silent = true`) skips the dependent
 * plugins' own deactivation hooks. Those callbacks routinely call
 * `openstation_*` helpers expecting OpenStation to be wired up;
 * firing them mid-cascade can trigger the same fatal we're trying
 * to prevent. Skipping them is the safer default.
