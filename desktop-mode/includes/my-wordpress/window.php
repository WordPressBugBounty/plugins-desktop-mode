 * OpenStation — My WordPress: the explorer's identity + shared helpers.

 * on the App Framework. This module keeps what the port shares: the
 * name and the folder-mark icon (the app reads both from the helpers
 * here), the capability gate, and the inert entities compatibility
 * surface (see the note at the end of the file).
 *
 * **The app is called WP Explorer; the module is called my-wordpress.**
 * The function prefix and every `openstation_my_wordpress_*` filter
 * are names plugins already reference — the frozen-values rule in
 * AGENTS.md keeps them put.
 *
 * Filterable surface:
 *
 *   - `openstation_my_wordpress_user_can_use`
 *   - `openstation_my_wordpress_entities` (inert — see the end note)
 *
 * (`openstation_my_wordpress_icon_args`, `_window_args` and
 * `_template_html` went with the legacy window they configured.)
 *

 * The app's icon: a folder wearing the WordPress mark.
 *
 * The window used to wear `dashicons-wordpress`, the double-ringed
 * wp.org mark, which said "WordPress" and nothing about what the app
 * does — every other window here is WordPress too. A folder says
 * "browse", and the single-ringed mark inside it says whose files.
 *
 * Drawn in `currentColor` so both painters mask it: the dock masks
 * image icons to the rail's own glyph colour so a plugin's brand
 * colours cannot break the monochrome rail, and `renderIcon()` masks it
 * to the title bar's text colour. A literal fill would silently turn it
 * back into a background image in one and a solid blob in the other.
 *
 * The folder is outlined rather than filled so the mark inside it stays
 * a mark: on a filled folder, a same-colour mark is invisible. Hand-
 * placed at 64×64, the established canvas for the custom icons here,
 * and held to two shapes because it renders as small as 20px in the
 * dock. The mark's own path is the upstream single-ringed logo, a
 * filled disc with the W knocked out by the nonzero fill rule.
 *
 * On the sizing: the front panel runs `y 19.1 → 52.1` on the
 * centreline, so at stroke 3 the clear height inside it is 30 units.
 * The mark takes 20 of those at scale 1, centred on 35.6, which leaves
 * five units above and below. It used to be scaled 1.15× for 23 units
 * and barely three units of clearance, less than one stroke width, and
 * a disc that close to the panel edge reads as crammed in rather than
 * placed. Horizontal clearance was never the constraint: the panel is
 * 50 units wide against the mark's 20.
 *
 * @return string Raw `<svg>` markup.
