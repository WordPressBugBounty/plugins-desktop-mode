/**
 * OpenStation — My WordPress: WooCommerce **Customers**.
 *
 * WooCommerce ships two views of the people who buy from a store, and
 * neither is a place you can work from: `users.php` is a role list that
 * knows nothing about money, and Analytics → Customers is a report you
 * read and then leave. Neither one opens next to the order it explains.
 *
 * This file adds a **Customers** section to the Woo folder in the site
 * window. It renders through the existing `user` entity kind — avatar
 * tiles, the dossier preview, the drag-out seam, the footprint route —
 * so a customer is a first-class object on the desktop: drag one onto
 * the wallpaper, open their orders beside their profile, tie the
 * windows together with the relations layer.
 *
 * What makes it a *customer* list rather than a user list is the
 * `openstation_woo_customer` payload on every row: lifetime spend,
 * order count, average order value, first and last order, days since
 * the last one, and the band that summarises all of it.
 *
 * ## Bands
 *
 * Ordered so the two bands a merchant can *act on* come first:
 *
 *   1. **VIP**    — spend at or above the VIP threshold (three times
 *                   the store's average order value by default). Who
 *                   to look after.
 *   2. **Lapsed** — has ordered, but not within the lapse window (180
 *                   days by default). Who to win back.
 *   3. **Repeat** — two or more orders, still active.
 *   4. **New**    — exactly one order.
 *   5. **No orders** — registered, never bought.
 *
 * ## Who appears
 *
 * Every user who has placed a paid order, plus every user holding the
 * `customer` role. Guests (orders with no account) have no user to
 * render — their revenue is reported as a single line on the Woo
 * folder's Store panel instead of being silently dropped.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * One grouped query over the order store gives every customer's
 * aggregate at once — order count, spend, first and last order date —
 * cached for five minutes and flushed whenever an order changes. The
 * band ordering, the per-row facts and the folder counts all read that
 * one map, so a page of customers costs no per-row order queries at
 * all. Stores past `OPENSTATION_WOO_MAX_ORDERED_CUSTOMERS` users skip
 * the band ordering and fall back to newest-first, exactly like the
 * catalogue does past its own cap.
 *
 * REST surface (read-only, gated on `list_users` + order access):
 *
 *   GET desktop-mode/v1/woocommerce/customers
 *   GET desktop-mode/v1/woocommerce/customers/<id>
 *   GET desktop-mode/v1/woocommerce/summary/customer/<id>
 *
 * @package OpenStation
