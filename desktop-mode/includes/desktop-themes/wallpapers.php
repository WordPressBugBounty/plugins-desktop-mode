/**
 * OpenStation — Desktop-theme wallpapers.
 *
 * A theme may declare any number of wallpapers in its manifest. Each
 * is published into the ordinary wallpaper registry as a pickable
 * entry labelled `<name> - (theme)`, alongside the built-in gradients
 * and canvas wallpapers. A theme shipping several names them, and the
 * label becomes `<name>: <label> - (theme)`.
 *
 * ## Why it is a pick and not an act
 *
 * Every other desktop OS swaps the wallpaper when you apply a theme.
 * We deliberately do not, because a wallpaper here is a **stored user
 * preference** (`wallpaper` in `desktop_mode_os_settings`), and
 * activating a theme would have to either overwrite that silently or
 * grow a shadow "what did they have before" record to undo it later.
 * Both are worse than simply offering the theme's artwork in the
 * place the user already goes to change wallpapers.
 *
 * The practical consequence is a nice one: a theme's wallpaper is
 * usable WITHOUT wearing the theme, and wearing the theme never
 * costs you the wallpaper you chose.
 *
 * Note this is separate from the `DESKTOP` texture slot. That slot
 * layers over whatever wallpaper is active and follows the theme;
 * this is a wallpaper in its own right that the user selects.
 *
 * @package OpenStation
