/**
 * Desktop Mode — Cascade cleanup of placements on entity trash.
 *
 * When a WordPress entity that a desktop shortcut points at is
 * trashed or deleted, the matching placement rows are soft-trashed
 * so the wallpaper stops painting tiles that resolve to nothing.
 *
 * Hooks cover every route an entity can leave the live set by:
 *
 *   - `wp_trash_post`      — post / page / attachment moved to
 *                            WP trash (our drag-to-trash, our CMO,
 *                            WP admin, WP-CLI all funnel through
 *                            this).
 *   - `before_delete_post` — force-delete (bypasses the trash
 *                            stage when `EMPTY_TRASH_DAYS === 0`
 *                            or the caller passed `force_delete`).
 *   - `delete_attachment`  — hard-delete path for attachments that
 *                            skips `wp_trash_post`.
 *   - `deleted_user`       — user account removed (with or without
 *                            content reassignment).
 *
 * Implementation is a bulk UPDATE that bypasses the per-placement
 * permission check used by user-initiated trash. The trashing
 * action has already been authorized at the entity level (Core
 * gates the `wp_trash_post` cap, `delete_users`, etc.); cascading
 * to the desktop shortcuts is a downstream side-effect of that
 * authorized action, not a fresh user gesture.
 *
 * Soft-trash semantics: `trashed_at_ms` is set but the row stays
 * in the table. The placement surfaces in the Recycle Bin and the
 * user can restore it from there (independent of the source entity's
 * trash status — restoring a post does NOT auto-restore its shortcut).
 *
 * @package WPDesktopMode
 * @since   0.8.9

/**
 * Soft-trash every live placement pointing at the given entity.
 *
 * Iterates `wp_desktop_mode_file_placements` for rows with the
 * matching `file_type` + `file_ref` whose `trashed_at_ms` is
 * unset, and stamps the trash columns. Each affected placement
 * fires `desktop_mode_files_after_cascade_trash_placement` so
 * plugins (and the live UI refresh path) can react.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running with an already-trashed entity is a
 * no-op because the `trashed_at_ms IS NULL` filter excludes
 * placements that were trashed by a previous pass.
 *
 * Bulk-friendly: the function tolerates an entity with many
 * placements across many users — the affected placement count
 * is unbounded by the API but bounded in practice by the number
 * of users who shortcutted the same entity.
