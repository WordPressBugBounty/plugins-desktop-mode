/**
 * Desktop Mode — Games bootstrap.
 *
 * Loads the game system: schema (scores + challenges tables), the
 * framework config (shared dictionary URL), the server-side
 * game registry, the score/challenge store, the play-time store,
 * REST routes, the Heartbeat challenge channel, the Games window +
 * desktop icon, and the built-in game registrations (Inkfall,
 * Alphabet Soup).
 *
 * The whole module is gated on the site-wide `games` extended option
 * (OS Settings → Features → Extended options, admins only), which is
 * OFF by default — games are opt-in. While the option is off, none of
 * the module files load — no tables check on `init`, no REST routes,
 * no Heartbeat channel, no window/icon — so the games framework costs
 * nothing beyond the option read below.
 * For third-party plugins the disabled state is indistinguishable from
 * Desktop Mode not being active: `desktop_mode_register_game()` is
 * undefined, which the documented `function_exists()` guard already
 * handles (see docs/examples/register-game.md).
 *
 * Loading is deferred to `plugins_loaded` (priority 5) so any regular
 * plugin can hook the `desktop_mode_games_enabled` filter in time to
 * influence the decision.
 *
 * New `require_once` lines belong in the loader below so the rest of
 * the codebase keeps loading the feature through one entry point.
