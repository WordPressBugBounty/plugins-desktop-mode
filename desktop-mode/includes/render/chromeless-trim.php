/**
 * OpenStation — chromeless asset trim.
 *
 * A window renders a real admin page with the admin bar suppressed:
 * `show_admin_bar` returns false and `wp_admin_bar_render` is removed
 * from `in_admin_header` (see `includes/helpers.php`), so `#wpadminbar`
 * never reaches the DOM inside a chromeless iframe. WordPress and the
 * host still enqueue the bar's scripts and styles, which then load,
 * parse and execute against markup that does not exist — once per
 * window, every window.
 *
 * Measured on a live WordPress.com install, one Settings window:
 *
 *   admin-bar.min.css               20.9 KB
 *   os-admin-bar.js (ours)          17.7 KB

 *                                             trips, for a bar the
 *                                             window does not draw.
 *
 * **Dequeue, never deregister.** A handle that stays registered can
 * still be pulled in as another script's dependency, which is exactly
 * the safety property we want: if some third-party script genuinely
 * depends on `admin-bar`, WordPress resolves it and that script keeps
 * working. Deregistering would strand the dependent instead. The cost
 * of that choice is that a dependency-pulled handle survives the trim
 * — correct behaviour, and the reason this list covers the whole
 * family rather than core's handle alone.
 *
 * Third-party handles ship in the defaults on purpose: they are
 * admin-bar-only by construction (a masterbar, a notifications panel),
 * and leaving them queued would drag core's `admin-bar` back in as a
 * dependency, undoing the trim. Sites that need one of them back can
 * filter it out.

 * measurement on current Chrome showed the 22 KB file genuinely
 * loading inside a window, because browsers routinely lag the newest
 * emoji.
 *
 * **Why dropping it in a window is still right.** Core sets the
 * precedent itself: `wp-admin/edit-form-blocks.php` removes this exact
 * action on the block-editor screen. The only thing lost inside a
 * window is that a very new emoji in admin content — a post title, a
 * comment — renders with the operating system's own glyph (or its
 * fallback) instead of a Twemoji image. And the shell that hosts these
 * windows already requires service workers, custom elements, ES2020
 * and `:has()`; a browser that clears that bar is not one that needs
 * help drawing emoji at all.
 *
 * Removal happens on `admin_init` because `wp_enqueue_emoji_styles`
 * rides `admin_enqueue_scripts` at the default priority — by the time
 * the handle trim above runs at `PHP_INT_MAX`, it has already fired.
 * This is the same hook and the same reasoning as the admin-bar

 * the palette is actually opened (`os-commands-subscribe`, sent from
 * `onPaletteOpened()` in `src/commands/iframe-bridge.ts`). The runtime
 * that answers that request was nevertheless loaded eagerly in every
 * window, on the chance the user might one day press ⌘K while that
 * window happened to hold focus.
 *
 * What that cost, measured on a live install opening Settings in a
 * window: 43 files, 10.66 MB raw / 1.94 MB gzipped — react, react-dom,
 * `components.js` (3.7 MB), `block-editor.js` (3.7 MB), `core-data`,
 * `blocks`, `sync` — **73.6% of everything the window downloaded**, then
 * parsed and executed again in each window's own JavaScript realm,
 * where an HTTP cache hit buys nothing.
 *
 * **Block-editor screens are exempt.** `post.php`, `post-new.php`, the
 * site editor and the widgets screen load that same chain for their own
 * reasons, so the palette rides along for the cost of `commands.js` +
 * `core-commands.js` (~150 KB) — and those are exactly the screens whose
 * stores hold commands worth harvesting ("Duplicate block", pattern
 * commands). Trimming there would cost real functionality and save
 * nothing. Everywhere else the store only ever holds the WordPress
 * baseline, which the shell already publishes itself from its own
 * lazily-loaded runtime (`src/commands/shell-harvester.ts`).
