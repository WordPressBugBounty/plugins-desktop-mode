/**
 * OpenStation — Progressive Web App support.
 *
 * Lets users install the WordPress site as a desktop / mobile app from
 * the openstation shell. Three concerns live here:
 *
 *   1. Web app manifest at `/openstation/manifest.webmanifest` —
 *      served via `parse_request` like the portal URL, no rewrite-rule
 *      registration. Site name, theme color, and icons assembled from
 *      the WordPress Site Icon (when set) with a wp-logo fallback. The
 *      `openstation_pwa_manifest` filter lets plugins mutate any
 *      field before encoding.
 *
 *   2. Service worker at `/openstation/sw.js`, served with the
 *      explicit `Service-Worker-Allowed: /` header so a single SW can
 *      scope across `/openstation/` AND `/wp-admin/` (their common
 *      ancestor is `/`). The plugin lives at
 *      `/wp-content/plugins/desktop-mode/`, which is NOT a parent of
 *      `/wp-admin/`, so wp-content-served SWs cannot reach admin pages.
 *      PHP delivery sidesteps that constraint cleanly.
 *
 *   3. Two REST routes scoped to the current user:
 *        - `GET/POST /desktop-mode/v1/pwa-state` — dismissal pref for
 *          the install hint, plus notification permission record.
 *        - (future) `POST /desktop-mode/v1/push-subscription` — Web
 *          Push subscription storage. Stub left here in a comment as
 *          a hint for the v2 push PR.
