 * OpenStation — Mio.
 *
 * Server side of the desk companion: the appearance / physics
 * defaults shipped to the shell, and the filter plugins use to
 * restyle or re-tune it.
 *
 * Mio itself is a lazy JS bundle (`assets/js/mio[.min].js`)
 * that the shell injects the first time a user switches it on from
 * the wallpaper context menu. Nothing here enqueues anything — the
 * bundle URL travels in the shell config as `mioBundleUrl`, and
 * the on/off preference lives in OS Settings as `mioEnabled`.
 *
 * Every value is re-clamped client-side in
 * `src/mio/config.ts::sanitizeMioConfig()`, so a filter that
 * returns nonsense produces a plain-looking Mio rather than a
 * broken shell.
 *
