/**
 * OpenStation — Agents module bootstrap.
 *
 * Agents are durable workers that live on the site as real WordPress
 * users and act through the WordPress Abilities API under their own
 * role and capabilities. Three layers:
 *
 *  - Guard      — the marker meta, the agent test, and every login /
 *                 session block → guard.php (ALWAYS loaded)
 *  - Identity   — the synthetic `wp_users` row itself → identity.php
 *  - Definition — everything else (system prompt, description, ability
 *                 allowlist, triggers, model override, rate limit) as
 *                 user meta on that row → store.php
 *
 * Plus the abilities bridge + runner (runner.php), a REST surface at
 * `/desktop-mode/v1/agents` (rest.php), privacy hooks (privacy.php),
 * the "Agent chat" native window (run-window.php), and the Agents
 * section inside WP Explorer (my-wordpress.php).
 *
 * The module is opt-in behind the `agents` extended option — while
 * off, no user-meta registration, no REST routes and no chat window.
 * Two files load regardless of the flag: guard.php and
 * my-wordpress.php. See below for why.
 *
 * @package OpenStation
