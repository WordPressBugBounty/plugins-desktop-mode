/**
 * OpenStation — Agents: authentication guard.
 *
 * Agents own a real `wp_users` row so capability checks, edit locks,
 * comment attribution, and the standard WordPress audit trail work
 * without a parallel ACL. The row is "synthetic" only in that no
 * credential may ever resolve to it: an agent is invoked on the site's
 * behalf, it never authenticates.
 *
 * This file is the security boundary for that claim, and it is the ONE
 * part of the agents module that loads unconditionally — the rest of
 * the module sits behind the `agents` extended option, but the blocks
 * must not. Turning the feature off does not delete the agent rows, and
 * a row whose login blocks unloaded with the feature is a row that
 * accepts application passwords and password resets again.
 *
 * Two layers, because they cover different halves of WordPress:
 *
 *  - The `authenticate` chain covers everything that presents a
 *    credential: wp-login.php, XML-RPC, and application passwords.
 *  - `determine_current_user` covers everything that presents a
 *    *session*: auth cookies, and any JWT / SSO / magic-link plugin
 *    that resolves a user id without going through `authenticate`.
 *    This is the one that matters, because the `authenticate` chain
 *    never runs for cookie validation — a third-party plugin calling
 *    `wp_set_auth_cookie( $agent_id )` would otherwise hand out a live
 *    agent session with no credential involved at all.
 *
 * `determine_current_user` deliberately does NOT interfere with the
 * runner: `wp_set_current_user()` sets the global directly and never
 * re-runs the filter, so switching into an agent to evaluate ability
 * permissions still works exactly as before.
 *
 * @package OpenStation

 * orphan data already written by live installs (or break a live

 * deliberate — it is NOT a half-finished rename.
