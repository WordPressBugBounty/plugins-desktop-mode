 * OpenStation — Agents: WP Explorer integration.

 * section config on the window's `config` payload (via
 * `openstation_my_wordpress_window_args`). The bundle side registers
 * the `agent` entity-kind renderer.
 *
 * This file loads regardless of the `agents` extended option (see
 * bootstrap.php) so the section is always discoverable. While the flag
 * is off the config carries `enabled => false` and the renderer paints
 * the section read-only — no REST call is attempted, because the
 * routes are not registered. It also carries `preview`, the cast the
 * site would get, read straight from `default-definitions.php`.

/**
 * The cast a site would get, for the flag-off state.
 *
 * A site that has never switched Agents on has no agents: `defaults.php`
 * only loads inside the flag, so the seeder has never run. That used to
 * make the off-state a paragraph of explanatory text, which is a weak
 * argument for turning something on. These are the same five cards the
 * grid draws once the flag is on, greyed and inert above the button
 * that flips it. Seeing who you would get is the argument.
 *
 * Only what a card draws: a name, a voice, what it is good for, and a
 * face. The instructions and the abilities are the bulk of a
 * definition and none of them are on screen here, so they stay out of
 * a payload that ships on every WP Explorer window open.
 *
 * Faces go through `openstation_mio_narrow_look()`, the same narrowing
 * the store applies when an agent saves one, so a preview cannot show
 * a face the seeder would then clamp into a different one.
 *
 * The role arrives already translated. A real card reads its label out
 * of the `/agents/roles` catalogue, and that route does not exist while
 * the flag is off — left to the client the badge would fall back to the
 * raw slug and five preview cards would say "editor" in English on a
 * Spanish site.

 *
 * `aiAvailable` is the cheap structural check (WP 7.0 AI Client +

 * is probed live by the renderer against `aiStatusUrl`, mirroring the
 * OS Settings Features tab, so a freshly configured connector is
 * picked up without a reload.
