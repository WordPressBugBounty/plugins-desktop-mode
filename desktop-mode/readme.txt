Turn wp-admin into a desktop OS — windows, dock, virtual desktops, and an AI assistant. Per-user opt-in, zero Core changes. By Automattic.

== Description ==

**Your WordPress admin, reimagined as a desktop.** Every admin screen opens as a draggable, resizable window — edit a post, browse the Media Library, and moderate comments side by side instead of one page at a time.

Desktop Mode is opt-in per user: one click in the admin bar switches you in, one click switches you back. Nobody else on the site sees any change, and deactivating the plugin restores the classic admin exactly. Zero Core patches — every feature runs through public WordPress hooks.

Built and maintained by [Automattic](https://automattic.com), the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack, WooCommerce, and Tumblr.

= A real desktop =

* **Windows** — drag, resize, minimize, maximize, snap, tile. Every admin page works, including plugin pages.
* **Dock & taskbar** — the admin menu becomes an icon dock; open windows live in a macOS-style taskbar.
* **Virtual desktops (Spaces)** — one desktop for writing, another for the store, another for moderation.
* **Files on the desktop** — drop posts, media, and links onto the wallpaper, organize them into folders, trash them to a Recycle Bin.
* **Session restore** — reload the browser and every window comes back exactly where you left it.

= Make it yours =

* **Wallpapers** — color presets, animated scenes, or your own image.
* **Widgets & desktop icons** — pin live widgets and shortcuts to the wallpaper; plugins can register their own.

= Superpowers =

* **AI Assistant (optional)** — press Cmd+K and ask *"Which post had the comment asking for the recipe?"* It searches your own content. Off by default; see "External services" below.
* **Content Graph** — an interactive, zoomable map of how your posts, pages, and products link together.
* **Cross-window drag & drop** — drag an image from the Media Library window straight into the editor in another window.
* **Command palette** — the full WordPress command palette plus slash commands from plugins, all under Cmd+K.

= Built to be extended =

Every significant behavior is hookable. Register windows, dock items, wallpapers, widgets, desktop icons, commands, settings tabs, and AI tools from your own plugin — stable `desktop_mode_register_*` PHP APIs, a typed JavaScript API, and copy-paste examples in the [developer docs on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/desktop-mode/tree/trunk/docs).

= External services =

This plugin's optional **AI Assistant** sends data to **OpenAI** (`https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`) when, and only when, an administrator configures an OpenAI API key in **Settings → AI**. With no key configured, no external requests are made.

When the AI Assistant is enabled and a user invokes it (via Cmd+K or the slash-command palette):

* **What is sent:** the user's prompt, the conversation history for the active session, the chosen model identifier (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`), and tool-call metadata. The plugin's built-in tools (`search_posts`, `search_pages`, `search_comments`) run WordPress's native keyword search and may include excerpts of the matching posts/pages/comments in tool results, which are then sent back to OpenAI as part of the agentic loop.
* **When it is sent:** on user-initiated AI requests, and (if enabled) on comment-save hooks for spam analysis. Comment spam analysis runs server-side as part of the comment-insert flow. Posts, pages, and taxonomy terms are not sent automatically.
* **Why it is sent:** to obtain model completions and tool-call decisions that drive the AI Assistant.
* **Who provides the service:** OpenAI, L.L.C. — see the [OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/) and the [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/).

The AI Assistant's provider layer is also extensible: third-party plugins may register additional providers via `desktop_mode_register_ai_provider()`. Those providers may send data to other endpoints; review each plugin's own privacy disclosure separately.

No other external services are contacted by this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress.
3. Click the **desktop** icon in the admin bar's top-right corner. The admin reloads inside the desktop shell.
4. Click the same icon again at any time to return to the classic admin.

= Optional: enable the AI Assistant =

1. Open **Settings → AI** inside desktop mode.
2. Paste an OpenAI API key and pick a model.
3. Press **Cmd+K** (or **Ctrl+K**) anywhere in desktop mode to open the AI palette.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this change anything for users who don't opt in? =

No. The classic admin is untouched until a user toggles desktop mode on for themselves. Deactivating the plugin restores vanilla Core exactly.

= Does the plugin require an external service to function? =

No. The desktop shell, windowing, dock, taskbar, virtual desktops, widgets, wallpapers, and all extension APIs work entirely on-site. The AI Assistant is the only feature that contacts an external service, and it is disabled until an administrator configures an API key. See "External services" in the description.

= Does it patch WordPress core? =

No. Every feature is wired through public WordPress actions and filters.

= How do I disable desktop mode for my user? =

Click the desktop icon in the admin bar a second time to flip the toggle off. The plugin can also be deactivated globally from the Plugins screen.

= Where is the developer documentation? =

In `docs/` inside the plugin, and on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/desktop-mode/tree/trunk/docs). The hook reference, JavaScript reference, bridge protocol, and copy-paste examples all live there.

== Screenshots ==

1. Real multitasking — Users, Media, and content editing open side by side as windows.
2. Your admin, your desktop — custom wallpapers and live widgets registered by plugins.
3. The AI Assistant (Cmd+K) answers questions about your own posts, pages, and comments.
4. Content Graph — an interactive map of how your content links together.
5. OS Settings — pick a wallpaper preset, an animated scene, or upload your own image.
6. Files on the desktop — drag posts, media, and links onto the wallpaper and into folders.
7. The Recycle Bin collects trashed posts, media, folders, and shortcuts in one window.

== Credits ==

Desktop Mode is brought to you by [Automattic](https://automattic.com). The plugin is open source under GPLv2-or-later; contributions are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/desktop-mode).

= Third-party libraries =

The plugin bundles the following third-party JavaScript library, loaded on demand only when a feature that needs it is in use:

* **[PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)** (MIT License) — used by the interactive **OS Settings → About** scene, the **Content Graph** window, and built-in canvas wallpapers (e.g. the animated WordPress logo). PixiJS is loaded from the plugin's own `assets/vendor/` directory; no CDN requests are made.
